*The above GIF shows levels one and two being played, out of a total eight levels. Additional levels will be added in a future release.*

### Supported Platforms
This game currently only runs on Windows 32-bit and 64-bit systems. However, support for macOS will be added in the near future.

### How to play
The controls of this game are very simple. They use the "W-A-S-D" keyboard control layout:

**A**: Move left

**D**: Move right

More advanced controls may be added in a future release.

### Installing
Notice in advance: **When your system tries to run the installer, you may get a warning from Windows SmartScreen or your antivirus.** If this does occur, make sure to skip past the warning (i.e. pressing "more info" on Windows SmartScreen will give you an option to run the executable). The reason as to why this happens is due to the software being unsigned, as I have not yet paid for a code signing certificate. I however do assure you, the end user, that nothing malicious is present in the installer script, nor the code of the Blockspeed game itself.

- Go to the "[**Releases**](https://github.com/suvanl/Blockspeed/releases)" page of this repository, and download the **BLOCKSPEED-Setup-x86.exe** file from version 1.0.0.

 - Once the .exe file has downloaded, run it. 

- Running the executable will present you with an installer. Running this installer will obviously install the game to your system. If you wish to, you can create a desktop shortcut for easier access. The installer is not complicated at all, and the game can be installed by just pressing "next" through the entire wizard.

- Once the setup wizard is complete, you should be able to run and play the game.
